                <p> My name is Beenish Munir Butt.
                    <br>Done Masters in E-Commerce from BZU Multan in 2005.
                    Then I started my family and planned to lookafter them
                    full time.
                    <p>I live in North Wales with my husband, two mischievous boys, adorable
                        little girl and a cutest cat. </p>
                    <p> Now all my kids are in school, I decided to pursue
                        my career in Web Development so I searched so many courses
                        and finally joined Coding Boot Camp in The University of Manchester.
                        <br>It's a good opportunity for me to reskill, improve and  learn new 
                        technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>When I was doing my Masters in E-Commerce, for my final
                        project I developed a result system of my department
                        which was running on the entranet of the Commerce department.
